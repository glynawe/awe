Saturday, August 8 2020:

* Changed array indexing to a more conventional system that uses
  array descriptor records rather than look up functions.
* Updated the Ocaml code to compile under Ocaml 4.05.0 
* Python scripts are explicitly run by Python 2

* Bugfix: NULL is now correctly recognised as not belonging to a record class

Thursday, June 20 2017:

Minor language changes:

* Added the operator "//" as a synonym for "|". (Rosettacode examples use it)
* "External class reference" extension removed.  (Wasn't necessary after all)
* Added a second printer directed at stderr. (Non-standard but useful)
* Algol W source files can now be run through GCC's standalone C preprocessor

Quietened compiler warnings:

* Made compiler code fully compatible with Ocaml 4.02.3
* Made runtime library fully compatible with glibc 2.24
* Added headers for call tracing functions to awe.h

Bugfixes:

* IOCONTROL(19999) did not give unlimited page width
* dividing integers with "/" was returning a integer not a real
* simply-typed array designators supplied as array actual parameters
  were not causing type errors and made Awe generate bad C code.

Tools:

* new Algol W syntax highlighting file for Gnome text editors in Tools/algolw.lang
* bugfix: logic symbols were wrong in Tools/algolw.ssh stylesheet for a2ps
* New example program: "macro", from Software Tools in Pascal


Thursday, Jun 15 2012: This revision of Aw2c to Awe has some minor changes, mostly removal of misfeatures:

 * Closer to the Algol W standard.
 * Minor bug fixes.
 * Improved command line. Awe calls gcc for itself.
 * A general-purpose Makefile is included.
 * Awe accepts multiple source files, which allows a primitive module system.
 * "External class" references, for returning pointers from external procedures.
 * Ocaml source code carefully revised.  (The comments were drivel.)
 * Manual is gone for now.  (Revising it.)
 * Variables are now never initialized.  (Dijkstra says no)
 * Only OS/360 and MTS Algol comments are allowed now.  (Was non-standard)
 * The procedure call tracing code hooks are gone.  (Wasn't satisfactory)
 * "Ref" is now never a keyword.  (Non-standard)
 * There are no mechanisms for mixing C and Algol at the source level.  (Was non-standard) (Wasn't satisfactory)
 * Only "ALGOL" and "FORTRAN" are valid external procedure references now.  (Was non-standard)
 * Programs must always be statements now.  (Was non-standard)
 * "Windows Funpak" distribution is gone.  (Couldn't be linked to a garbage collector)
 * Records are now allowed as parameters to external procedures.
